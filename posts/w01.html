      <h2>Week 01 – My First Journal Entry</h2>

      <!-- Intro Paragraph -->
      <p>This week, I learned valuable lessons about entrepreneurship and the importance of self-reflection. I love that this class encourages us to develop the habit of journaling. Keeping notes on new ideas, quotes, or study material makes the learning process smoother and helps me see patterns in my thinking. Sometimes I struggle to find the right words, but as I strive to learn, grow, and seek inspiration, they come more easily.</p>

      <!-- Key Takeaways List -->
      <p>The reading <em>Your Entrepreneur’s Journal</em> was especially helpful. Key takeaways for me include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep your journal in a format you can easily update and refer to.</li>
        <li>Record personal insights, rules of thumb for success, and important questions. Visual aids like diagrams can be powerful reminders.</li>
        <li>Capture ideas as they come and review them regularly.</li>
        <li>Reorganize your journal periodically for easier use, record dates and sources, and index keywords.</li>
        <li>Don’t worry about writing perfectly—focus on your learning.</li>
        <li>Start now; the sooner you begin, the sooner you can build habits that support success.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Video Reflection -->
      <p>One video that stood out was Guy Kawasaki’s <em>Do What You Love and the Money Will Follow</em>. His message of pursuing what you love resonated deeply with me. As a mother, this is advice I hope to pass on to my children: find your talent, discover what you love, and pursue it. Personally, I know what I love, but sometimes struggle to turn it into profit. I know I must find a way.</p>

        <p class="quote-text">
          Now be faithful. Be true. Go forward. Be ambitious. Don’t short-circuit yourself. Don’t stop now. Keep going. Keep going. Educate your minds and your spirits, and never lose sight of the fact that you’re a child of God with a divine destiny, capable of doing great and good and wonderful things. Don’t sell yourself short. Don’t cheapen yourselves. You know who you are. You are a child of God, and your Heavenly Father expects something great, noble, and good from each of you.

      <p>The reading <em>Your Whole Soul as an Offering Unto Him</em> by Elder David A. Bednar was also inspiring. I love that our leaders are well-educated, excel in their professions, and love the Lord so much that they serve wholeheartedly wherever He calls. They teach by example, and I am so thankful for them.</p>

        <p class="quote-text">
          A disciplined and educated mind is a tool for reasoning, inquiring, evaluating, and discerning. These abilities are essential skills for a spiritual, happy, and productive life. The combination of spiritual strength and mental capacity allows us to act for ourselves rather than be acted upon.

      <p>The introductory material for this course was all excellent. I love that BYU-Idaho’s Introduction to Entrepreneurship course is designed to help us know ourselves, our strengths, our passions, and even our weaknesses, and to help us chart a course forward to achieve extraordinary things.</p>

      <p>Finally, the video <em>The Start-Up of YOU: Rediscovering the Entrepreneurial Spirit in All of Us</em> left a strong impression. It reminded me that all humans are born entrepreneurs, capable of taking control of their careers and building the future they want. The entrepreneurial spirit exists in each of us; learning from others, adapting, taking smart risks, and leveraging networks can help us achieve extraordinary things.</p>

      <!-- Quote Box: Startup of YOU -->
      <div class="quote-box">
        <div class="quote-mark">“</div>
        <p class="quote-text">
          All humans were born entrepreneurs. In the caves, we were self-employed, finding food and feeding ourselves. That is how human history began, and that is the entrepreneurial spirit we must rediscover. We have within ourselves the ability to take control of our careers and build the future we want. We do this by learning from the lessons of today’s entrepreneurs and applying them to our lives: how we adapt, how we develop a competitive edge, how we take smart risks, and how we use our networks. Today’s challenges present enormous opportunities. We were made to survive almost anything. We can invent ourselves and invent the future. The startup is you.

      <!-- Closing Paragraph -->
      <p>Overall, this first week has set a strong foundation for reflection and growth. I am excited to continue journaling, capturing “Aha!” moments, and applying the lessons I learn in both my personal and professional life. This journal is becoming more than just a class assignment; it is a tool I can carry into the future to track my development as a thinker and doer.</p>

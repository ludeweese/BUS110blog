      <h2><strong>Week 01: Entrepreneurial Reflection</strong></h2>

      <p>
        This week, I learned valuable lessons about entrepreneurship and self-reflection. The readings and videos emphasized the importance of keeping a journal to track insights, challenges, and small successes in the journey of learning business principles. Writing down my thoughts helped me see patterns in my thinking and understand areas where I can grow.

        One concept that resonated with me was [insert a concept from readings/videos]. I realized that applying this idea to my own life could help me become more organized and intentional with my goals. Additionally, reflecting on my personal experiences gave me a clearer picture of my strengths and weaknesses in entrepreneurial thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking forward, I am excited to continue this practice and see how it helps me make better decisions, both personally and professionally. This journal is becoming more than just a class assignment—it is a tool that I can carry into the future to capture my “Aha!” moments and track my growth as a thinker and doer. Overall, this first week has set a strong foundation for consistent reflection and learning.
